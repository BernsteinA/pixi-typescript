## Typescript Definitions for Pixi.js v4.x

_Note_ This repository is not intended for v5.x which ships with its own generated declarations.

When using v5.x, you can use `import * as PIXI from "pixi.js"` without the need for `@types/pixi.js`

## Install

The recommended install is from DefinitelyTyped using:

`npm install @types/pixi.js --save-dev`

This repository contains the most recent version of the declarations for pixi.js and follows the [v4.x branch](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js/tree/v4.x) with periodical [Releases](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi-typescript/releases) which are supposed to match pixi releases by the core team.

Each release is pushed to DefinitelyTyped.

Any advice, suggestions or improvements would be appreciated.
